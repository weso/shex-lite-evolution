Before you initiate a pull request, please read the process document.

This repository tracks the ongoing evolution of ShEx-Lite. It contains:

  - Goals for upcoming ShEx-Lite releases (this document).
  - The ShEx-Lite evolution review status tracking proposals to change ShEx-Lite.
  - The ShEx-Lite evolution process that governs the evolution of ShEx-Lite.
  - Commonly Rejected Changes, proposals that have been denied in the past.

This document describes goals for the ShEx-Lite language on a per-release basis. These releases include minor releases that add to the currently shipping version plus one major release out. Each release will have many smaller features or changes independent of these larger goals, and not all goals will be reached for each release.

For historical purposes, the bottom of the document includes goals for past versions. These goals do not necessarily indicate which features actually shipped for a given version. Those are documented in each version’s release notes.

## Development major version: ShEx-Lite 1.0

Planned released on May 2020

### Primary Focus: Error system and Performance improvement.

The ShEx Lite 1.0 release **will** be focus on the error system and the performance improvement respect to the current [ShEx-S](https://github.com/weso/shex-s) implementation. That way the 1.0 release will only support ShExC syntax as stated in [SE0001](proposals/0001-compact-syntax.md).
