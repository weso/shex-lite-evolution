## Introduction

By default the `AND` keyword is optional but this adds lots of ambiguity to the grammar. If we make it compulsory to use we're still in the subset of ShEx but reducing ambiguity.

## Motivation

We test both options againts the ANTLR profiler. When allowing AND not to be pressent we had a red warning about our grammar being ambiguos and a parse of almost 4 ms with a k of 100+. On the other hand if the AND keyword is mandatory the parse time is 0.9 ms and the k value lows to 21 with no ambiguity warning.

## Proposed solution

Make the `AND` keyword compulsory.

## Comment
The main purpose is for the system to represent data obtained from tabular models, therefore this expression is outside the scope of the project, at least for the moment.
